      <h1 class="text-5xl text-white ml-10  mt-10 underline underline-offset-4 " style="font-family: 'Akira', sans-serif;">About Me</h1>  
      <p class="text-xl text-white ml-10 mt-10 text-justify mr-10 " style="font-family: 'louis', sans-serif;">I am a highly skilled and motivated front-end web developer and designer with a passion for creating visually stunning and user-friendly websites. With experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various web development frameworks, I am able to create responsive and dynamic websites that not only look great, but also function seamlessly.

        I have been interested in web development and design since high school, where I first began dabbling in HTML and CSS. As I delved deeper into the field, I became increasingly fascinated with the endless possibilities of the web and the impact it has on our daily lives. I began to experiment with different design techniques, as well as coding languages, and quickly realized that this was the field I wanted to pursue.
        
        Throughout my high school years, I have taken several classes related to web development and design, including computer science and graphic design. I have also participated in various coding competitions and hackathons, where I have honed my skills and gained valuable experience working in a team.
        
        In addition to my technical skills, I am also a creative and detail-oriented individual with a keen eye for design. I understand the importance of creating visually appealing websites that are easy to navigate, and I am always looking for new and innovative ways to improve the user experience.
        
        I am eager to continue learning and growing as a web developer and designer, and I am excited to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world projects. Whether it's working on a personal website or collaborating with a team on a larger project, I am committed to creating websites that are not only beautiful, but also functional and user-friendly.</p>
